# Push-Pull
This code, viewable version on [http://pgjones.github.io/push-pull/](http://pgjones.github.io/push-pull/), is for the [third annual Github data challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge).
It will plot statistics for the lifetimes of pull requests (or issues) for various users and as a function of commits, changes etc...
The aim is to look for correlations that hint at reasons why some pull requests take much longer to merge.
For example are long lifetimes a communication problem between specific users or just a function of the pull request size.
